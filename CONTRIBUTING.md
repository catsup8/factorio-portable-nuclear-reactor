# Contributing

You are welcome to submit any contribution and improvement to this mod. Please create a PR and I will take a look

Currently, what is needed the most in this mod are icons and graphics. I used base Factorio icons and graphics as placeholders. If you want to contribute to those, just put the images in the `images` directory and write in the PR what is the image for, or maybe you can put the image directly in the config files
